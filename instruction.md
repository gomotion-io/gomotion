now that remotion js have the web renderer (https://www.remotion.dev/docs/web-renderer/)
we dont need the gomotion-agent backend server anymore and we will remove it in the future.
everything will be done in nextjs. no backend server anymore.

first thing first is too have animations routes working. this is what you should focus and implement now.

instead of just copying the agent code. create a new agent directly in our nextjs project that will use best practices, to be the best agent for generating remotion code, you also have access to remotion skills. the new agent should be simple but powerful.
